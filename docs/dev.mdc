## Development Guidelines

### API & Real-time
- REST APIs are exclusively in RPC proto files
- Use WebSocket protocol for real-time features
- API routes are defined in `server.ts` with Fastify

### Testing
- Create tests using vitest
- Global features need mocked tests to ensure coverage

### Code Quality
- Never keep DEPRECATED code in the project
- Use independent files for TS code and components
- Keep pages small and focused on page-level logic
- Don't cast to `any` without a good reason and without approval, prefer to use the specific type

### Styling
- Keep the app minimalist style with black and white colors using browser or system preferences (dark or light mode)
- Use React Router to update navigation between pages, prefer using `<a>` over button with onclick js routing

### Development Server
- To check TS issues and application, run `pnpm dev` (unified server on port 3000)
- Watch mode shows issues and errors in the console
- Faster than running `pnpm build`

### Best Practices
- Create tooltips for all actions and buttons in the app
- Don't re-export functions and components in index.ts files (not a good practice and not necessary)
- Don't export a type or function if it's not used in another file
