rest api are exclusively in RPC proto files
use websocket protocol for real time features.

as a developer create testing of the project using vitest.
global features needs to haved mocked tests to ensure coverage.

never keep DEPRECATED code in the project.


in nextjs, use indepdenant files for ts code and components and sub components, keep page.tsx small and focused on the page global logic

keep the app minimalyst style with black and white colors.
use react router to update the navigation between pages, prefer using <a> over button with onclick js routing

to check the ts issues and application run use `pnpm dev` it's in watch mode so you can see the issues and errors in the console. it's really faster than doing `pnpm build` 

don't cast to `any` without a good reason and withouy my approval, prefer to use the specific type.
