# Testing

## Framework
- Use Vitest for unit tests and component tests.
- Mock global features for coverage and isolation.

## Setup (planned)
- Add `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, and `jsdom`.
- Configure `vitest.config.ts` and basic `test` script in `package.json`.

## Guidelines
- Test public surface of components (props → UI behavior).
- Mock network/realtime boundaries; don’t hit real routers in unit tests.
- Keep tests fast; avoid global state bleed.
